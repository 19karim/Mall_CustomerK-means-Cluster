**Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering**

**Overview**

This project focuses on utilizing K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their characteristics. The dataset contains information on customers, including gender, age, annual income, and spending score. The goal is to identify clusters of customers with similar attributes and characteristics to target them effectively.

**Dataset**

The dataset includes the following columns:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.

Gender: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).

Age: Age of the customer.

Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer in thousands of dollars.

Spending Score (1-100): A score assigned to the customer based on their spending behavior.

**Methodology**

The K-Means clustering algorithm is employed to group customers into clusters based on their features. This unsupervised machine learning technique helps identify patterns and relationships within the data.

**Steps:**

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to handle any missing or irrelevant information.

Feature Selection: Relevant features are selected for clustering. In this case, 'Age,' 'Annual Income,' and 'Spending Score' are used.

Scaling: To ensure that all features contribute equally to the clustering process, numerical features are scaled to have similar magnitudes.

K-Means Clustering: The K-Means algorithm is applied to group customers into 'k' clusters based on their similarities.

Cluster Analysis: The characteristics of each cluster are analyzed to understand the distinct profiles of customers within each group.

Targeted Customer Identification: Based on the cluster analysis, the business can identify and target specific customer segments with tailored marketing strategies.

**Results**

The final results include insights into customer segments, allowing businesses to understand and target specific groups effectively. The identified clusters help in personalizing marketing efforts and enhancing customer satisfaction.
